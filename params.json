This format is no longer recommended for use, as it has been superseded by the more widely-implemented BCF2.\r\n\r\n**BCFv2_qref.tex** is a quick reference describing just the layout of data within BCF2 files.\r\n\r\n[ena-cram]:   http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/cram_toolkit\r\n[htslib]:     https://github.com/samtools/htslib\r\n[samtools]:   https://github.com/samtools/samtools\r\n[tabix]:      https://github.com/samtools/tabix\r\n\r\n<!-- vim:set linebreak: -->\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
