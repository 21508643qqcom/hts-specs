# Ensure PDF files are left as binary.  To roughly display changes in them
# by converting to text, add to your configuration (perhaps with --global):
#
#	git config diff.pdf.textconv pdftotext-filter
#
# where pdftotext-filter is a wrapper around pdftotext, similar to
#
#	#!/bin/sh
#	pdftotext -nopgbrk -q "$@" -
#
*.pdf	-text diff=pdf
